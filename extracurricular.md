# Teaching 
During both my undergradute and graduate careers, I have had the opportunity to teach in addition to doing research (listed below). Both times, my duties included grading homework and tests, holding office hours, and conducting tutorial/discussion sessions. Teaching has given me valuable practice in explaining technical topics to a wide variety of students. Though challenging, I have found the experience to be rewarding, especially in cases where I was able to help a student understand a topic with which they were previously struggling. 

- 2021: Teaching assistant for "Discrete Math" (EECS 203) at the University of Michigan
- 2018: Teaching assistant for "Introduction to the Theory of Computer Science" (CSC 236) at the University of Toronto

# Outreach
I have also been fortunate to have the opportunity to serve the community through outreach activities (listed below). I enjoy participating in a variety of activities, though I mainly focus on encouraging under-represented minoritites to participate in computing activities and advising other students.

- 2023: Volunteered for Xplore Engineering, a program that introduces engineering concepts to 4th-7th graders
- 2021: Served as an “Onboarding Buddy” for new graduate students
- 2021: Assisted in facilitating F.E.M.M.E.S explore (an event that encourages under-represented gender minorities to participate in computing)
- 2020: Mentored for the “Summer Undergraduate Research Experience” at the University of Michigan
- 2019: Volunteered at “Explore Graduate Studies” (a program aimed at recruiting under-represented minorities for graduate studies)
- 2018-2022: Volunteered at the Michigan AI Symposium (a one-day symposium highlighting the department's research)
- 2014: Volunteered on a student panel for math course selection
